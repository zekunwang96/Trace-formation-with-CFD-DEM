# Trace-formation-with-CFD-DEM
This repository contains the CFDEM (www.cfdem.com) and Matlab codes with our own developments to reproduce trace fossils in different environments (three zip files) and deduce putative trace-makers (GithubCurve.m). 

Codes.zip contains the CFDEM solvers to reproduce translational and rotational motion of the trace-makers/appendages (cfdemSolverPisoSTL0, cfdemSolverPisoSTL), along with the necessary force models (gradPForce, viscForce, GidaspowDragsemi). Steps to compile these codes are written in Readme.

Benchmark_case.zip contains a benchmark validation of the moving cube on submerged sands. Appendage.zip contains a moving appendage on subaerial wet sands.
